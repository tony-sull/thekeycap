Keyboard switches are probably one of the most confusing decisions mechanical keyboard newcomers have to make. Switches are often by color, but there are as many as nine different colors. What do they all mean? When it comes to brands, Cherry seems to be the go-to but why are they better than Gateron, Kailh, or any of the other brands out there?

Before we dive into all the details, let get a few basics out of the way. Still not sure what size keyboard to get? [Our keyboard layout comparison](https://thekeycap.com/learn/comparing-keyboard-layout-sizes) has you covered.

## How Do Mechanical Keyboard Switches Work?

If you haven't joined the club yet, you may not understand why it's worth ditching your cheap membrane switch keyboard for a mechanical one. If you have seen the light, you likely already own more than one mechanical keyboard and have a whole list of ones you would love to add to your collection!

It's hard to go back after making the switch. To understand why, lets look at exactly how they work and what the difference really is.

### Membrane Keyboards

Unless you're still rocking your IBM keyboard from the 80s, you're likely most accustomed to a membrane-based keyboard. These keyboards are cheaper to produce and are more spill resistant, at the expense of tactile feedback and accuracy.

These keyboards consist of three membranes stacked together with a dome-shaped switch beneath each key. Pressing the key compresses the three membranes together and creates a connection between the top and bottom membranes through a hole inbetween. Connecting the top and bottom completes an electric circuit telling the computer that you pressed the key.

Most membrane keyboards are expected to last as little as 1,000,000 keypresses, though some improved designs are tested up to 15 million keypresses. One million keypresses may sound like a lot until you realize how many times you type the letter 'e'.

### Mechanical Keyboards

Mechanical keyboards use individual physical switches to trigger a keypress. This distinction seems a bit unimportant at first, after all who cares how the key works as long as you can press it and the computer recognizes the click.

Once you try a mechanically equipped keyboard you will likely notice the improvement in tactile feedback. You can hear when the key is pressed, not because there's a vague spongy rattle as your laptop key is depressed, but a very pointed click as the physical button is pushed.

The feel of the keys is also very different. Where membrane-based keys can often feel spongy mechanical keys feel extremely precise. The loudness of the click and force required to depress the key is largely based on which switch you pick, but they will without a doubt feel more responsive than pressing on a rubber membrane.

## A Little History of Mechanical Keyboards

Mechanical keyboards have been around for decades, with [Cherry](https://cherryamericas.com) being the most well known manufacturer of switches. They began making keyboards in 1973, and claim to be the oldest keyboard manufacturer that is still in business.

Cherry MX switches are the most broadly known switches today, and are a safe choice if you're just getting into mechanical keyboards. They were originally patented in 1983, and once the patent expired in 2003 it really opened the flood gates for other manufacturers. Razer, Gateron, Kailh, and many others now offer great switches that were originally based on the Cherry MX patent.

Innovation never sleeps, and though other manufacturers were able to leverage the patented design after it expired they all continue to tweak designs and one-up each other. Thankfully for us, they have kept it slightly less confusing by keeping the same Cherry MX color distinctions.

## Which Keyboard Switch Color is Right for Me?

Now to the good stuff, what all the colors really mean. Cherry decided to differentiate their MX switches with colors based on the tactile behavior of the switch. Some switches take more force to depress than others, some are louder than others, and some have a tactile click that you can feel as you type.

### Red Switches

Red switches are referred to as linear switches. They are quite, smooth, and free of the tactile bump or or click.

These keys themselves are nearly silent, but since there is no tactile feedback it is easier to bottom out the key. O-rings can be added to avoid the plastic-on-plastic noise made when the key bottoms out against the bottom of the switch, at the cost of key travel and an altered feel.

### Brown Switches

Tactile switches have a brown stem. They have a small, tactile bump that can be felt when the key press is triggered but do not include any audible clicks.

Brown switches are a great all-around option. Once you get used to the tactile feedback you will find yourself bottom out keys less often, and because the switches don't have audible feedback you won't annoy anyone sitting nearby.

### Blue Switches

Blue switches are often referred to as the clicky option. These switches give both a tactile and audible feedback when a key is pressed. Users who are rather heavy handed often go with blue switches for the heavier feel and precise indicator of keypresses.

These switches aren't well suited for gamers unfortunately. These are the only category of switch that often have hysteresis, which is when the release point of the switch is higher than the actuation point. This can cause issues when playing games, especially if you find yourself pressing the same key repeatedly.

### Alternative Colors

Three distinct types of switch may not be enough to fit everyone's prefences. What if you want a linear switch because you hate the tactile feedback, but want a heavier feel in the keys?

Don't worry, Cherry has you covered! Oh yeah, and the other manufacturers generally offer a similar spread of switches for your typing pleasure.

Check out the comparison chart below for the full breakdown. Each category (linear, tactile, and clicky) have been expanded with choices of firmness.

## Conclusion

Choice of keyboard switches often comes down to personal preference. Generally, reds are common for gaming and browns are frequently chosen by career typists, but there aren't hard and fast rules here.

When it comes to brands, Cherry MX is always a great choice and makes a good default if you aren't sure. Gateron and Kailh make great switches as well, and are often cheaper than Cherrys, but each has a slightly different feel.

If you're just testing the waters and aren't interested in getting to into the weeds, here's a few general rules of thumb:

Are you looking for a gaming keyboard?

> Go with red switches. Does most of your use revolve around typing documents, emails, etc.? Brown switches are your best bet. Are you heavy handed when typing, and not concerned with noise levels? Blue switches should serve you well.
