Nail down the keyboard layout size that best fits your needs to narrow down the search early. </section> <p>Shopping for mechanical keyboards can be exhausting. Before diving into which switches you prefer, wired vs. wireless, or custom keycaps it can be helpful to nail down the layout size that best fits your needs.</p> <h2 class=font-medium>60%, 65%, 75%, 80%, 100% - Why are there so many sizes?</h2> <p>Lets stick to the basics. For our purposes the main sizes are 60%, 80% aka tenkeyless, and 100% aka full-size.</p> <p><img alt="Keyboard Layout Size Diagram with Form Factors" src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/ANSI_Keyboard_Layout_Diagram_with_Form_Factor.svg title="Keyboard Layout Size Diagram with Form Factors"></p> <p>As you can see in the diagram above, 60% keyboards are the most compact size and consist only the essentials. With 80%, or tenkeyless, keyboards you also get arrow and function keys, including things like page up/down and print screen. 100%, or full-size, keyboards take it a step further with the inclusion of a full number pad.</p> <p>The size you choice comes down to personal preference and how you use your keyboard, but we'll get into the pros and cons shortly.</p> <p>If you come across something listed as a 65% keyboard, that is basically a 60% layout plus the arrow keys. This still won't have any function keys found on the larger layouts. There are other middle of the road layouts between 60% and 80%, those usually are adding in the functions row in some form.</p> <p>90% layouts are also uncommon but you may come across them occasionally. Consider this to be a 60% plus the function keys and number pad, but no arrow keys.</p> <p>I'm sure there are more custom layouts that you could throw random percentages at, but stick to the 60%/80%/100% directions when deciding on your layout and you'll be on your way.</p> <h2 class=font-medium>60%</h2> <p>The compact 60% layout seems to be the most common choice made. This is my personal preference, and if you aren't sure what you need I would go with this one. You will have countless options to choose from, and you'll save a few bucks if you buy new switches or keycaps down the road.</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Pros of the 60%</h3> <h4 class=font-medium>Size (duh)</h4> <p>Size is obviously the main benefit here. If you don't live in excel and never find yourself reaching for the dozen function keys on a regular basis, avoid the clutter and go with the option that takes up the least desk space.</p> <h4 class=font-medium>Plenty of Options</h4> <p>If you have a long list of must haves, you will have an easier time checking all the boxes with a 60% layout. Obviously if a number pad is a must-have then you can ignore this, but if you want Cherry MX Silver switches, programmable LEDs, an anodized aluminum case, a removeable USB-C cable, etc. you may find keyboards that check every box in a 60% but have to custom build one to get all those features in a tenkeyless layout.</p> <h4 class=font-medium>Cost</h4> <p>Not surprisingly, 60% keyboards will be cheaper than the same keyboard in a larger size. Less keys means less switches and caps, so it's cheaper to manufacture and cheaper for you to upgrade down the road.</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Cons of the 60%</h3> <h4 class=font-medium>Missing Keys</h4> <p>This seems obvious, but if you need a number pad, arrow keys, or function keys then keep reading on.</p> <h4 class=font-medium>Can Feel too Cramped</h4> <p>Some people find the smallest size too feel too cramped, even if the keyboard uses the same key size and spacing as their larger siblings.</p> <p>Manufacturers have also been known to go off the beaten path and shrink certain keys in a 60% layout to add a few extra features. This can get annoying if you don't notice until later that the shift key you always use is slightly smaller than normal.</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Who is the 60% best for?</h3> <p>The 60% keyboard layout is perfect for you if you are short on desk space, regularly carry your keyboard with you on the road, or simply have no need for all the extra keys.</p> <h2 class=font-medium>80% (Tenkeyless)</h2> <p>Tenkeyless keyboard layouts are also very popular. Interestingly, when weighing the pros and cons of the tenkeyless size I rarely see someone deciding between 80% or 60% sizes. The smallest layout is a no brainer if you have little need for all the extra keys, but often the indecision is related to the usefulness of the number pad compared to how much space it actually takes up.</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Pros of the Tenkeyless</h3> <h4 class=font-medium>Free Up Desk Space Compared to Full-Size</h4> <p>It isn't obvious how big the jump in size is until you see them side by side. The tenkeyless layout will save you quite a bit of desk real estate that you can use for a larger mousepad, extra space for papers, or to simply declutter for your own sanity.</p> <h4 class=font-medium>Keep the Mouse Nearby</h4> <p>If you find yourself jumping between the keyboard and mouse regularly, getting rid of the number pad can really help. Not only will you have to move your arm less while working, but you can always add an external number pad if you really need it for certain tasks.</p> <p>It's worth noting that the full-size keyboard layout goes back much further than the mouse. I'm not so sure a number pad would have been bolted on to the right side of a keyboard knowing that most people use their right hand for a mouse.</p> <h4 class=font-medium>More Comfortable on Your Lap</h4> <p>Tenkeyless keyboards will be much more comfortable to use on your lap compared to full-size keyboards. Heck, 80% layouts are a real goldilocks olution if you often find yourself resting a keyboard in your lap. The number pad makes a full-size layout too wide and off-centered for lap use, and a 60% layout is a bit too narrow to balance easily.</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Cons of the Tenkeyless</h3> <p>There aren't really cons for the tenkeyless layout so much as trade-offs. If you absolutely need a number pad for daily use, a full-size is the obvious choice. If you are tight on desk space or really prefer the minimalist approach, go with a 60%. Otherwise the tenkeyless keyboards may just be right for you!</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Who is the Tenkeyless best for?</h3> <p>Though 60% keyboards tend to be more common in gaming, tenkeyless layouts are also a great option. It's also a great choice if you regularly reach for the arrow keys, whether playing a game or navigating a spreadsheet.</p> <h2 class=font-medium>100% (Full-Size)</h2> <p>Definitely the least common size these days, full-size layouts still have a place in the world. Personally I'm not a fan of such large keyboards, but I'll do my best to be objective here.</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Pros of the Full-Size</h3> <p>The number pad, though not often necessary, is extremely useful in specific scenarios. Accountants will live on the number pad, taking it away would be a mistake.</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Cons of the Full-Size</h3> <p>Size is the obvious downside here. Not only does it take up a large chunk of space on your desk, it isn't very portable, and most importantly pushes your mouse further away. I can't stress enough how important it is to consider ergonomics if you use your keyboard regularly.</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Who is the full-size best for?</h3> <p>Accountants and others who spend a disproportionate amount of typing time on the number keys will have the most to gain here.</p> <p>My main concerns regarding distance to your mouse also may not matter to you if you prefer keyboard shortcuts to mouse navigation.</p> <h2 class=font-medium>Custom Layouts and Split Designs</h2> <p>There are some very interesting and well built keyboards out there that break the mold. Some, like the <a href=https://www.amazon.com/Kinesis-Advantage2-Ergonomic-Keyboard-KB600/dp/B01KR1C5PY class=underline>Kinesis Advantage2</a> double down on ergonomics and completely redsign the concept of what a keyboard should be. Others, like the <a href=https://www.amazon.com/AULA-Progammable-Handed-Merchanical-Keyboard/dp/B0728P6DR5 class=underline>AULA 30 One Handed Gaming Keyboard</a> are built from the ground up for gamers.</p> <p>These can be excellent solutions if they fit your needs (and budget), but don't expect to plug it in and keep up your 110 words per minute from day one. There is a learning curve to these, and can take a month or two to really take advantage of the custom layouts.</p> </div> </article> </main> <footer class="svelte-17dqaf1 bg-shades-dark items-center px-4 py-3 text-shades-light text-sm" role=contentinfo> <div class="svelte-17dqaf1 content max-w-4xl md:p-8 mx-auto p-2 xs:p-6"> <ul class="text-shades-light w-full font-semibold"> <li> <a href=/about class=svelte-17dqaf1 alt=About>About Keycap</a> </li> <li> <a href=/contact-us class=svelte-17dqaf1 alt="Contact Us">Contact Us</a> </li> </ul> <ul class="text-shades-light w-full font-light"> <li> <a href=/privacy-policy class=svelte-17dqaf1 alt="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> </li> <li> <a href=/terms-of-use class=svelte-17dqaf1 alt="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a> </li> <li> <a href=/partners class=svelte-17dqaf1 alt="Partnerships and Advertising"> Partnerships and Advertising </a> </li> <li> <a href=/feed class=svelte-17dqaf1 target=_blank title="RSS Feed">RSS Feed</a> </li> </ul> <div class=w-full> <strong>Lets be friends!</strong> <ul class="svelte-17dqaf1 flex flex-row my-3" id=social> <li class=svelte-17dqaf1> <a href=https://www.facebook.com/thekeycap class=svelte-17dqaf1 title="Keycap's Facebook" id=facebook> <img alt="Keycap's Facebook" src=/facebook-circle.svg class="svelte-17dqaf1 logo"> </a> </li> <li class=svelte-17dqaf1> <a href=https://www.twitter.com/thekeycap class=svelte-17dqaf1 title="Keycap's Twitter" id=twitter> <img alt="Keycap's Twitter" src=/twitter-circle.svg class="svelte-17dqaf1 logo"> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=font-thin> You can <a href=/contact-us class="svelte-17dqaf1 inline underline">send us a note</a> too. </div> </div> </div> <div class="text-center text-xs mt-2 md:mt-8 xs:mt-6"> © 2019 Keycap.

If you absolutely need a number pad for daily use, a full-size is the obvious choice. If you are tight on desk space or really prefer the minimalist approach, go with a 60%. Otherwise the tenkeyless keyboards may just be right for you!\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 class=\" font-medium\"\u003EWho is the Tenkeyless best for?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThough 60% keyboards tend to be more common in gaming, tenkeyless layouts are also a great option. It's also a great choice if you regularly reach for the arrow keys, whether playing a game or navigating a spreadsheet.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2 class=\" font-medium\"\u003E100% (Full-Size)\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDefinitely the least common size these days, full-size layouts still have a place in the world. Personally I'm not a fan of such large keyboards, but I'll do my best to be objective here.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 class=\" font-medium\"\u003EPros of the Full-Size\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe number pad, though not often necessary, is extremely useful in specific scenarios. Accountants will live on the number pad, taking it away would be a mistake.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 class=\" font-medium\"\u003ECons of the Full-Size\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESize is the obvious downside here. Not only does it take up a large chunk of space on your desk, it isn't very portable, and most importantly pushes your mouse further away. I can't stress enough how important it is to consider ergonomics if you use your keyboard regularly.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch3 class=\" font-medium\"\u003EWho is the full-size best for?\u003C\u002Fh3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAccountants and others who spend a disproportionate amount of typing time on the number keys will have the most to gain here.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy main concerns regarding distance to your mouse also may not matter to you if you prefer keyboard shortcuts to mouse navigation.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2 class=\" font-medium\"\u003ECustom Layouts and Split Designs\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are some very interesting and well built keyboards out there that break the mold.
