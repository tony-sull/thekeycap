It can be overwhelming once you start comparing keyboard sizes, key switch colors, and brands. Start here for a quick rundown of the best mechanical keyboards for your gaming style.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Our Pick</th> <th></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan=5><img alt="Ducky One 2 Mini" src=/ducky-one-2-mini.jpg></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Akko-Ducky-One-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07MCNVN8C/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=ducky+one+mx+cherry+red&qid=1569881061&sr=8-3" class=underline>Ducky One 2 Mini</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>Our recommended overall keyboard</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>The 60% layout is a great middle-of-the-road size, is customizable, and works just as well for office work between games.</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Akko-Ducky-One-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07MCNVN8C/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=ducky+one+mx+cherry+red&qid=1569881061&sr=8-3" class=underline>Buy on Amazon</a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Akko-Ducky-One-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07MCNVN8C/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=ducky+one+mx+cherry+red&qid=1569881061&sr=8-3" class=underline>Ducky One 2 Mini</a> is an excellent place to start if you're looking for your first mechanical keyboard and are willing to pay for some high-end features.

Qisan did an excellent job cutting extra features like LED lights and brand name key switches. Its definitely a no-frills keyboard, but if you're looking to dip your toes before diving deep into the world of custom built mechanical keyboards, you won't find a better keyboard for the money.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Wireless</th> <th></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan=5><img alt="Anne Pro 2" src=/anne-pro-2.jpg></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anne-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Backlit/dp/B07PSH8V4Y?th=1" class=underline>Anne Pro 2</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>Our recommended wireless keyboard</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>A go-to gaming keyboard if you need wireless connectivity without breaking the bank.</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anne-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Backlit/dp/B07PSH8V4Y?th=1" class=underline>Buy on Amazon</a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>If wireless connectivity is on your must-have list, stop reading now and order the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anne-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Backlit/dp/B07PSH8V4Y?th=1" class=underline>Anne Pro 2</a>. This one is very similar to the Ducky and will run around the same price, but where the Ducky is wired-only the Anne Pro 2 can be used wirelessly. Wireless keyboards come with the usual caveats of having to keep them charged, but avoiding extra wires running across your desk may be worth the trade-offs.</p> <h2 class=font-medium>The Research</h2> <ul> <li class=mb-2><a href=reviews/best-mechanical-keyboards-for-gaming#why-mechanical-keyboards class=underline>Why Mechanical Keyboards</a></li> <li class=mb-2><a href=reviews/best-mechanical-keyboards-for-gaming#good-gaming-keyboard class=underline>What Makes a Good Gaming Keyboard</a></li> <li class=mb-2><a href=reviews/best-mechanical-keyboards-for-gaming#top-choice class=underline>Tony's Top Choice Mechanical Keyboard for Gaming</a></li> <li class=mb-2><a href=reviews/best-mechanical-keyboards-for-gaming#top-high-end class=underline>Best High-End Mechanical Keyboard for Gaming</a></li> <li class=mb-2><a href=reviews/best-mechanical-keyboards-for-gaming#top-budget class=underline>Best Budget Mechanical Keyboard for Gaming</a></li> <li class=mb-2><a href=reviews/best-mechanical-keyboards-for-gaming#top-wireless class=underline>Best Wireless Mechanical Keyboard for Gaming</a></li> <li class=mb-2><a href=reviews/best-mechanical-keyboards-for-gaming#top-first class=underline>Best First Mechanical Keyboard for Gaming</a></li> <li class=mb-2><a href=reviews/best-mechanical-keyboards-for-gaming#why-hot-swappable class=underline>Why do I need hot swappable switches?</a></li> <li class=mb-2><a href=reviews/best-mechanical-keyboards-for-gaming#conclusion class=underline>Conclusion</a></li> </ul> <h2 class=font-medium id=why-mechanical-keyboards>Why Mechanical Keyboards?</h2> <p>Regardless of your budget, mechanical switches make a huge difference in your gaming experience. Not only do they last longer than membrane keyboards, they respond more quickly to key presses and you can cherry-pick the switches and keycaps to fit your style and personality.</p> <h2 class=font-medium id=good-gaming-keyboard>What Makes a Good Gaming Keyboard</h2> <p>This is kind of a trick question, "good" is very subjective when it comes to mechanical keyboards. If you already know what you like then obviously stick with that, but if not a good starting point is a wired, tenkeyless keyboard with Cherry Red switches.</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Do You Need Wireless?</h3> <p>There are good wireless options including the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anne-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Backlit/dp/B07PSH8V4Y?th=1" class=underline>Anne Pro 2</a>, if that is really important to you. Pay close attention to latency issues with wireless keyboards, many people looking for a general purpose keyboard won't notice a difference but it because abundantly clear once you start gaming.</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Does Size Really Matter?</h3> <p>Many people like full-size (100%) keyboards for gaming, and there are even people playing on keyboards half the size, but the tenkeyless size is a great starting point. The tenkeyless layout is basically a full-size keyboard without the number pad found on the right side. Yes these numpads can be used as directional buttons when gaming, but they also take up more desk space and move your mouse further away from you. The ergonomics really can't be overlooked here, and don't ignore the slight increase in speed reaching your mouse when you don't need to move past the number pad everytime.</p> <h3 class=font-medium>Key Switches Make All The Difference</h3> <p>Key switches are the most subjective decision to make when buying a mechanical keyboard for PC gaming. Some people swear by Cherry Browns, others like Blacks or Blues. Personally, I recommend Cherry Red switches for anyone buying their first gaming keyboard. The Reds are more smoother, faster, and slightly more quiet than the others.</p> <p>Why Cherry switches rather than Razer, Kailh, or any of the other brands out there? Cherry switches are the gold standard. They've been in this game the longest, and most of the competition started by closely imitating their design. That isn't to say the other brands aren't worth considering. This is a situation where you should stick with what you know, if you love Razer Greens then by all means use those. If, however, you aren't sure where to start I would go straight to the classic Cherry Red MX and know that you have a great set of switches for gaming.</p> <h2 class=font-medium id=top-choice>Tony's Top Choice Mechanical Keyboard for Gaming</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Our Pick</th> <th></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan=5><img alt="Ducky One 2 Mini" src=/ducky-one-2-mini.jpg></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Akko-Ducky-One-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07MCNVN8C/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=ducky+one+mx+cherry+red&qid=1569881061&sr=8-3" class=underline>Ducky One 2 Mini</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>Our recommended overall keyboard</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>The 60% layout is a great middle-of-the-road size, is customizable, and works just as well for office work between games.</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Akko-Ducky-One-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07MCNVN8C/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=ducky+one+mx+cherry+red&qid=1569881061&sr=8-3" class=underline>Buy on Amazon</a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>I'm always looking for the bang-for-your-buck factor, and when it comes to gaming that means the Ducky with MX Reds. Ducky keyboards are extremely popular, and short of building your own custom keyboard it's hard to beat the price. I prefer the 60% layout for gaming because it keeps your mouse within close reach, you can add a separate keypad and customize the key mappings.</p> <p>Like many mechanical keyboards, the Ducky is very customizable. It comes with extra keycaps in the box, but you can always buy your own set to personalize the look and feel. It has different RGB lighting modes if that's your thing, and the detachable USB-C cable means you can bring your own cables to match the custom keycaps and lighting. In case you're wondering, there are also feet on the back of the keyboard to allow you to angle it towards you if that's your bag.</p> <p>This is a great overall keyboard, even if the name is a bit confusing and long-winded. It will be just as enjoyable if you spend most of your day writing whitepapers for grad school but it really shines when gaming. Though I prefer the MX Red switches, you do have the option to go with MX Blues or Browns if you know what you like.</p> <h2 class=font-medium id=top-high-end>Best High-End Mechanical Keyboard for Gaming</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Our Pick</th> <th></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan=5><img alt="Kinesis Freestyle Edge" src=/kinesis-freestyle-edge.jpg></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Gaming-Freestyle-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B07STXYG5T/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=kinesis%2Bfreestyle&qid=1569943805&sr=8-1&th=1" class=underline>Kinesis Freestyle</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>Our recommended high-end keyboard</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>The split design is ideal for long gaming sessions.

Repetitive stress injuries (RSIs) are no joke, ignore your health and you can easily end up with hand, wrist, and even shoulder pains that won't go seem to away.</p> <p>The split design allows you to put each half of the keyboard exactly where your hands are most comfortable. Often that means separating your hands further than possible on a normal keyboard, and when gaming that can let you conveniently place a mouse or keypad in the middle.</p> <p>Kinesis even includes wrist rests with they keyboard, you often have to purchase these separately. It is unfortunate that the <a href=https://www.amazon.com/KINESIS-Lift-Tenting-Freestyle-Edge/dp/B077J7ZBM class=underline>Kinesis Tent Kit</a> isn't included. Tenting is when you tilt the middle of the split keyboard to provide a more natural angle for your wrists and hands. I wish it was included in the box, but do yourself a favor and buy the tent kit when getting the keyboard. Your wrists will thank you!</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Runner Up</th> <th></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan=5><img alt="Leopold FC750R PD" src=/leopold-fc750r-pd.jpg></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leopold-FC750R-High-end-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B079JQP9XX/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=leopold+cherry+red&qid=1569880893&sr=8-1" class=underline>Leopold FC750R PD</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>Another great high-end option</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>This is a great option if you want no-compromise features but aren't a fan of the split design.</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leopold-FC750R-High-end-Mechanical-Keyboard/dp/B079JQP9XX/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=leopold+cherry+red&qid=1569880893&sr=8-1" class=underline>Buy on Amazon</a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>The Leopold FC750R is worth an honorable mention here. If you don't like, or don't have the desk space for, the split keyboard design I'd definitely pick the Leopold. This is a tenkeyless sized keyboard, meaning you get a full-sized keyboard minus the numberpad. The dedicated function and arrow keys are a plus, even if not a deciding factor compared to a 60% keyboard like the Ducky One 2 Mini.</p> <p>Leopold offers this keyboard in a range of colors depending on the switches you prefer. I prefer the MX Reds with a black case and black keycaps, but it's great to see that they give you options.</p> <p>Note that this keyboard doesn't feature LED lights like many of the other keyboards do. I'm not a huge fan of the LEDs and often disable them on keyboards that have it, but you may need to look elsewhere if you want a high-end tenkeyless keyboard with programmable LEDs.</p> <h2 class=font-medium id=top-budget>Best Budget Mechanical Keyboard for Gaming</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Our Pick</th> <th></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan=5><img alt="Qisan Mini" src=/qisan-mini.jpg></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Qisan-Mechanical-Keyboard-68-Keys-Magicforce/dp/B01E8KO2B0/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=varmilo+keyboard&qid=1569881198&sr=8-1" class=underline>Qisan Mini</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>Our recommended budget keyboard</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>Easily the best mechanical keyboard if you're on a tight budget and don't extra features like LED lighting.</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Qisan-Mechanical-Keyboard-68-Keys-Magicforce/dp/B01E8KO2B0/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=varmilo+keyboard&qid=1569881198&sr=8-1" class=underline>Buy on Amazon</a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>If you're in the market for a mechanical keyboard but aren't willing to drop $100+, the Qisan Mini is an excellent choice. Like any budget option there are tradeoffs, but Qisan really did an excellent job of balancing cost vs. features and quality.</p> <p>You can spend more on a set of Cherry switches than this complete keyboard costs, so it's no surprise that Qisan didn't use Cherrys in this one. It does come with Brown switches rather than Red, but they are very comfortable to use and don't have any issues registering clicks. The keycaps are surprisingly comfortable to type on, and you can always upgrade those down the road if you'd like to upgrade without spending your hard-earned cash on another keyboard.</p> <p>This is a no-frills keyboard, so don't expect any extra features like wireless support or programmable LEDs. If you're in need of a mechanical keyboard to improve your gaming experience, and aren't interested in all the bells and whistles, this is a great option that should last you many years.</p> <h2 class=font-medium id=top-wireless>Best Wireless Mechanical Keyboard for Gaming</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Our Pick</th> <th></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan=5><img alt="Anne Pro 2" src=/anne-pro-2.jpg></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anne-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Backlit/dp/B07PSH8V4Y?th=1" class=underline>Anne Pro 2</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>Our recommended wireless keyboard</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>A go-to gaming keyboard if you need wireless connectivity without breaking the bank.</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anne-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Backlit/dp/B07PSH8V4Y?th=1" class=underline>Buy on Amazon</a></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>I was very torn between the Ducky One 2 Mini and the Anne Pro 2 when it comes to my overall pick. Many mechanical keyboard enthusiasts swear by the Anne Pro 2, and it's a no-brainer if wireless conectivity is on your list of must-haves.</p> <p>The Anne Pro 2 can be had with your choice of quite a few different switch options. Cherry switches are great, and an easy go-to that I can recommend without reservation, but Gateron and Kailh offer great switches as well and can be a great way to save a few bucks. Prices are always changing, but generally Gateron switches will be the cheapest of the three, with Kailhs costing around $20 more and Cherrys often upping the price by as much as $40 compared to the Gaterons.</p> <p>I'm a big fan of the keycaps that are included on this keyboard. It's so easy to go down the rabbit hole once you dip your toes in the world of Mechanical Keybaords, but I'm not sure that I would bother swapping the caps out.</p> <h2 class=font-medium id=top-first>Best First Mechanical Keyboard for Gaming</h2> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Our Pick</th> <th></th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td rowspan=5><img alt="HUO JI Z88" src=/huo-ji-z88.jpg></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td><a href=https://www.amazon.com/HUO-JI-Mechanical-Resistant-Anti-Ghosting/dp/B07CN5YKW6 class=underline>HUO JI Z88</a></td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>Our recommended entry-level keyboard</td> </tr> <tr> <td></td> <td>A great first gaming keyboard with some higher-end features like LED lights.

If you've made it this far you see how many options there are, and how much it comes down to personal preference.</p> <p>So what to look for in your first keyboard? By far, the most helpful feature is going to be hot swappable switches. This keyboard also uses a removable/replacable USB cable, offers the almost obligatory LED lights, and though it isn't a true tenkeyless layout it does have more keys than a 60% layout.</p> <h2 class=font-medium id=why-hot-swappable>Why do I need hot swappable switches?</h2> <p>Most mechanical keyboards are manufactured with their switches soldered directly to the board. Technically you can swap them out, but it's very delicate work that can easily lead to a keyboard-shaped door stop. Keyboards with hot swappable switches allow you to easily pull out the original switches and put in new ones. Say you take my advice and start with red switches, only to decide that you would like a more firm press or more audible feedback. You can make that change without starting the whole buying process over again, and without learning how to desolder the old switches.</p> <h2 class=font-medium id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2> <p>Yes this is a budget keyboard, and you may decide to replace it down the road with a more common name brand item, but it really is a great starting point for the money. Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks up front, you may want to try out different switches or keycaps and the price will add up.</p> </div> </article> </main> <footer class="svelte-17dqaf1 bg-shades-dark items-center px-4 py-3 text-shades-light text-sm" role=contentinfo> <div class="svelte-17dqaf1 content max-w-4xl md:p-8 mx-auto p-2 xs:p-6"> <ul class="text-shades-light w-full font-semibold"> <li> <a href=/about class=svelte-17dqaf1 alt=About>About Keycap</a> </li> <li> <a href=/contact-us class=svelte-17dqaf1 alt="Contact Us">Contact Us</a> </li> </ul> <ul class="text-shades-light w-full font-light"> <li> <a href=/privacy-policy class=svelte-17dqaf1 alt="Privacy Policy">Privacy Policy</a> </li> <li> <a href=/terms-of-use class=svelte-17dqaf1 alt="Terms of Use">Terms of Use</a> </li> <li> <a href=/partners class=svelte-17dqaf1 alt="Partnerships and Advertising"> Partnerships and Advertising </a> </li> <li> <a href=/rss.xml class=svelte-17dqaf1 target=_blank title="RSS Feed">RSS Feed</a> </li> </ul> <div class=w-full> <strong>Lets be friends!</strong> <ul class="svelte-17dqaf1 flex flex-row my-3" id=social> <li class=svelte-17dqaf1> <a href=https://www.facebook.com/thekeycap class=svelte-17dqaf1 title="Keycap's Facebook" id=facebook> <img alt="Keycap's Facebook" src=/facebook-circle.svg class="svelte-17dqaf1 logo"> </a> </li> <li class=svelte-17dqaf1> <a href=https://www.twitter.com/thekeycap class=svelte-17dqaf1 title="Keycap's Twitter" id=twitter> <img alt="Keycap's Twitter" src=/twitter-circle.svg class="svelte-17dqaf1 logo"> </a> </li> </ul> <div class=font-thin> You can <a href=/contact-us class="underline inline svelte-17dqaf1">send us a note</a> too. </div> </div> </div> <div class="text-center text-xs mt-2 md:mt-8 xs:mt-6"> © 2019 Keycap.

By far, the most helpful feature is going to be hot swappable switches.

Technically you can swap them out, but it's very delicate work that can easily lead to a keyboard-shaped door stop. Keyboards with hot swappable switches allow you to easily pull out the original switches and put in new ones. Say you take my advice and start with red switches, only to decide that you would like a more firm press or more audible feedback. You can make that change without starting the whole buying process over again, and without learning how to desolder the old switches.\u003C\u002Fp\u003E\n\u003Ch2 id=\"conclusion\" class=\" font-medium\"\u003EConclusion\u003C\u002Fh2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYes this is a budget keyboard, and you may decide to replace it down the road with a more common name brand item, but it really is a great starting point for the money.
