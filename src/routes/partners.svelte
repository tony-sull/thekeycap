  to live a better life. Keycap's extensive independent research has found
  audiences beyond our site with partners who use our work to serve their own
  audiences.

<h4>Affilate Partnerships</h4>

<p>
  Readers visit Keycap when they are ready to make a purchase decision. Our
  exhaustive process and hours of extensive testing have built trust with

  carry a Keycap-recommended product or service and are interested in
  establishing an affiliate partnership, please email us at

  Every pick on our site is an award winner, and being named best in class by

  product that our editors named as the best, you can license our logo or
  editorial text to show potential customers how great your gear is. Please
